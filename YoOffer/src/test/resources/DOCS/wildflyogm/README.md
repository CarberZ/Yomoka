Here I add Dockerfile and configuration files I use to build fpezzati/wildflyogm image which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fpezzati/wildflyogm/).
Notice that at line 2 of wildfly-hibernateogm-dockerfile directory org is copied. Directory org is hibernate-ogm .zip exploded ready to be added as module to wildfly.
